I've compiled additional data for the top 100 U.S. liberal arts colleges with strong Political Science departments, ranked by acceptance rate. This data includes details such as acceptance rates, student enrollment, and more from various reputable sources.

I will now finalize the Excel file containing the top 100 liberal arts colleges based on their acceptance rates and Political Science program strengths. Please give me a moment.

It looks like there was an issue with the data due to a mismatch in the lengths of the arrays. I'll correct this and regenerate the Excel file for you. Please hold on.
