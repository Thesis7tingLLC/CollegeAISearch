To compile a list of the top 100 Mass Communications departments at U.S. liberal arts colleges based on acceptance rate, I'll need to gather data from various sources. However, I can generate a preliminary list for you by focusing on schools known for their strong Mass Communications programs and then ranking them according to acceptance rates.

Since this requires real-time data collection, I will create a file based on known top liberal arts colleges with strong communication programs and their general acceptance rates. If you'd like more recent or specific data, that would require access to real-time sources, which I can browse for you.

Let me generate the preliminary list for you and provide it in an Excel format. I'll start with schools that are widely recognized for their Mass Communications programs. Please give me a moment to prepare this file.

It seems there was an error due to mismatched data lengths in the lists I provided. I'll correct that and try generating the Excel file again.
