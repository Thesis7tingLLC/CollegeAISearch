Creating a list of the top 100 psychology departments at U.S. universities based on acceptance rates requires a bit of approximation since acceptance rates are typically reported for entire universities rather than specific departments. However, I can provide you with a list of notable undergraduate psychology departments and estimate rankings based on the overall university acceptance rates.

I’ll start by gathering the relevant information and compiling it into an Excel file for you. This will take a moment.

It seems there was an issue with the data input. I'll fix that and regenerate the Excel file for you. ​

The issue is that there are more universities listed than there are acceptance rates provided. I'll correct this by trimming the list of universities to match the number of acceptance rates. I'll then generate the Excel file for you.

len(universities), len(acceptance_rates)
