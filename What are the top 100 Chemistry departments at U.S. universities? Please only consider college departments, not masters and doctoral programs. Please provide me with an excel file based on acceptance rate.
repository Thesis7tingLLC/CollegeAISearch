Compiling a list of the top 100 undergraduate Chemistry departments at U.S. universities based on acceptance rates is a complex task, as specific rankings of Chemistry departments for undergraduates are not as widely available as overall university rankings. Furthermore, acceptance rates are typically reported for entire universities, not individual departments. However, I can create an Excel file based on the general acceptance rates of universities that are known for having strong Chemistry departments.

I will generate the list based on the overall reputation of the universities and their acceptance rates, keeping in mind that these universities are known for their strong Chemistry programs.

Let me create this file for you.

It appears that there was an issue with the data lengths, which caused an error. Let me correct this and generate the Excel file for you.
